Deploying an Online Doctor’s Clinic Application on Cloud
### Description

You work for a Healthcare company and as a Cloud Architect, you are asked to deploy the LiveDocApp website on cloud.

 

## Background of the problem statement:

The company has created a new website for the LiveDocApp where the patient can add their details in the website. The company wants to use a public cloud for the internet facing website of LiveDocApp. Once the website was deployed, patients started complaining that the pages are not loading fast enough. You realized that the website gets global traffic and the static assets like pages are served from a single server. You need to make sure that the traffic coming to the application from different parts of the world is load balanced at the DNS level.

You can use either Azure or AWS platforms to design the solution using IaaS OR PaaS.

 

## You must use the following tools:

AWS: Route 53, S3 Bucket, CloudFront, EC2

Azure: Azure App Service, CDN, DNS, Azure VM, Azure Traffic Manager

 

## Following requirements should be met:

1. Suggest an appropriate solution so that your company can make use of cloud while keeping the requirements mentioned above for your company in mind

2. Provide an approach to:

a. Govern all the resources being used for development, testing, and production of the company’s website.

b. Keep a separate track of the billing life cycle and cost management of all the services being used for hosting the company’s website on Cloud

3. Upload all static content of your website to cloud

4. Create a CDN endpoint and configure it to serve the static files you have uploaded

5. Use storage service and upload files for your teammates to share

6. Connect Windows or Linux VM to the Storage service
